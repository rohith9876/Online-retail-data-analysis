The purpose of the analysis is to extract insights with business value for an online retailer using R, tidyverse, sparklyr, and Spark. A large part of the analysis consists of data cleaning and basic exploratory analysis, as usually is the case with data science projects. After those basic steps, I employ machine learning algorithms on Spark to uncover more complex customer behavior patterns, like which products are frequently purchased together.
